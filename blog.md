## DTML | 10 Dec. 2019
Today, I created [CTML](https://langlang.tech/ctml) (**C**olon **T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage), a coding language that is meant to mimic HTML, but be more simplistic. It acheives this by using smaller tags to replace HTML's. For example, `<p>foo</p>` would be `;-foo;` in CTML. This reduces confusion and clutter. The only problem is, I have no idea how to make the computer actually understand the language; it's just a concept for now.

## Apps | 4 Dec. 2019
I added a few apps that you can add to your website through Cloudflare. The apps added are the social icons in the footer, the sticky in the lower right corner, the loading bar, the search bar in the blog, and the back to top button. Thank you so much Cloudflare and the people who developed the apps! My website is much better now.

## Chat Room | 3 Dec. 2019
I have created a chat room where you can talk about HTML and CSS. You are free to ask, or answer questions that people ask about HTML coding and CSS, or just talk about your website. You can also advertise your website with HTML/CSS and its source code.

[The link for the chat room](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#html.css:matrix.org).

## IP Fixed | 2 Dec. 2019
Today, I fixed the problem. All I did was change the wrong name servers to the right ones administered by Cloudflare, and it was fixed. I am glad my website is online again. Soon I will set up my website email, so you can email me soon. I will add the link when I activate the email. I also added Creative Commons licensing on my projects page.

## 404 | 24 Nov. 2019
Today I updated the [404 page](langlang.tech/404). I added the funny dog pic because why not. Also, my computer is acting up. The shift key is not working very well. I have a 2018 MacBook Air with the retina display. Any suggestions for my computer (or the website) can go in the google form on the main page.
