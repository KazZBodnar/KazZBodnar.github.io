## IP Fixed | 2 Dec. 2019
Today, I fixed the problem. All I did was change the wrong name servers to the right ones administered by Cloudflare, and it was fixed. I am glad my website is online again. Soon I will set up my website email, so you can email me soon. I will add the link when I activate the email.

## 404 | 24 Nov. 2019
Today I updated the [404 page](langlang.tech/404). I added the funny dog pic because why not. Also, my computer is acting up. The shift key is not working very well. I have a 2018 MacBook Air with the retina display. Any suggestions for my computer (or the website) can go in the google form on the main page.

Website of the day: [Hoefler & Co](https://typography.com).
