`LangLang`

I use [repl.it](https://repl.it/@KazZBodnar/langlang) to test the code and how it looks, and I paste it into GitHub to finalize.

I also have a blog on my website. View it [here](https://langlang.tech/blog).

LangLang is coded with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Special shout-out to [Kaz Malhotra](https://github.com/KazMalhotra) and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) for helping me get this started.
